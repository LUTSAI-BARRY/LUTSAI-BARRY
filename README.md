## Practical Cybersecurity Incident.

In 2024, my LinkedIn account was compromised, leading to a temporary loss of data. This incident gave me the opportunity to apply my cybersecurity skills in a real-world scenario. I successfully regained access to the account, implemented enhanced security measures (e.g., two-factor authentication, regular password updates), and began the process of rebuilding my professional network. This experience has strengthened my understanding of account security and reinforced the importance of proactive defense strategies.
